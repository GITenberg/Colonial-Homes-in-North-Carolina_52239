<p>The following statement was published in the original
printing of <i>Colonial Homes of North Carolina</i>: &ldquo;The Carolina
Charter Tercentenary Commission was established by
the North Carolina General Assembly &lsquo;to make plans and develop
a program for celebration of the tercentenary of the
granting of the Carolina Charter of 1663....&rsquo; As part of this
program the Commission arranged for the publication of a
number of historical pamphlets for use in stimulating interest
in the study of North Carolina history during the period 1663-1763.
This publication is part of that project.&rdquo; Because of the
widespread acceptance of this particular pamphlet and continuing
demand for it, the Division of Archives and History
of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources is
reprinting it. When the Carolina Charter Tercentenary Commission
went out of existence at the end of 1663, its stock of
publications was turned over to what was then the State
Department of Archives and History. Since that time several
of the pamphlets originally published by the commission
have been reprinted.</p>
<p>Because of monetary limitations, it has not been possible to
update this publication. Readers should be aware of the fact
that a number of projects in progress at the time Dr. Allcott
wrote the booklet, such as the Museum of Early Southern
Decorative Arts in Winston-Salem and Tryon Palace in New
Bern, have been completed.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Carolina Charter Tercentenary Commission
was the Honorable Francis E. Winslow of Rocky Mount;
executive secretary was Brig. Gen. John D. F. Phillips, U.S.
Army (Ret.).</p>
<p>The awareness of the importance of structures of historical
significance has increased with the recent emphasis on historic
preservation. It is appropriate, therefore, that Dr. John
V. Allcott&rsquo;s work on North Carolina&rsquo;s colonial homes be
kept in print.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>This booklet, planned for young student readers, discusses
a group of colonial homes scattered over North Carolina,
which remain and can be seen today. They begin in the
early 18th century, for earlier homes have long since disappeared.
The fate of these first buildings is likewise the fate
of most of the churches, courthouses, and other non-domestic
structures built during colonial times. Homes, therefore,
chiefly constitute the first group or body of architecture remaining
from the early and mid-18th century.</p>
<p>Architecture of the final years of the colonial period will
be mentioned only lightly. During this later time new ideas
of elegance came into North Carolina architecture, as in the
well known Tryon Palace, to which we will refer later. For
many people who have not thought very much about colonial
architecture, these elegant later buildings, and also those of
the early Republic, stand somehow for all or the best of
&ldquo;colonial&rdquo; architecture, and the exciting architecture of an
earlier, bustling, genuinely colonial period is not recognized.
It will be useful in this booklet, therefore, to focus on the
architecture of the earlier 18th century and see the simple,
vigorous ideas of this period.</p>
<p>These buildings are of surprising variety&mdash;they are made of
brick, stone, or wood; they are large and small, plain or
fancy in one way or another. A reason for such diversity is
that the colonists, coming from different foreign countries and
settlements in America, brought with them differing ideas
about what a building should look like and how it should be
constructed. These early buildings, however, do hold together
as a group. More important, they show the rise of architectural
ideas especially suited to the hot Carolina summers.
Thus, we view our material both as expressive of a genuine
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
&ldquo;colonial&rdquo; period, and as establishing ideas which reflect
Southern life.</p>

<p>Besides talking about colonial architecture as an important
aspect of colonial history, this booklet has two special purposes.
One is to interest the student in architecture itself.
Some people go through their whole lives without ever being
conscious about buildings they like or dislike; they do not
wonder why one building looks gay, another sober, and
others pompous or unpretentious. This study will provide a
number of approaches to architecture. Using everyday vision,
so to speak, we will see photographs of buildings from outside
and inside, in long-shot and close-up. We will see buildings
in plan views and diagrams which show in a few lines
what a photograph cannot. We will look down on buildings
and cities from high in the air (via maps). And we will look
with X-ray eyes into the construction of buildings. In these
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
and other ways a person begins to experience the manifold
realities of architecture and to understand how architecture
ranks with painting and sculpture as a great, compelling art.
Buildings and cities are the material frame created by man,
in which he can breathe and live life as he desires it.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p001.jpg" alt="Inspecting a house foundation" width="500" height="388" />
</div>
<p>The other special purpose of this booklet is to induce the
student to investigate old buildings in his or her area&mdash;to
find them, prowl through their basements and attics to see
how they were made, make sketches and take photos of them,
look up records, and talk to old citizens about them.
People who do this are detectives in a sense; it may take
months before the mysteries of a particular building are
solved. This is very important work. Each day old buildings
are destroyed without any record for architectural history.
Such a record can be made only by someone on the spot over
an extended period of time&mdash;someone like the reader of this
study.</p>

<br />Colonial North Carolina Seen from the Air</h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>We begin our study from the air. First, like an astronaut
high in his rocket ship, we will look down on colonial maps
of North Carolina and survey the whole 500-mile sweep of
the land from mountains in the west to meandering sea
coast in the east. Next, as if in an airplane, we will look at
maps of colonial towns. Then, coming closer to the earth,
as in a helicopter, we will hover over a single home with its
several outbuildings and see what it is like. From this point
on, with our feet on the ground, we will look at buildings
close-up.</p>
<h3>OLD MAPS OF NORTH CAROLINA</h3>
<p>There are quite a number of old maps of North Carolina.
Some are small&mdash;the size of a piece of typing paper; others
are huge&mdash;assemblages of several large sheets of paper. Early
maps, not very accurate in detail, show a few settlements.
Later maps are more accurate and show the new towns as
they were established.</p>
<p>Back of a colonial map stands a surveyor who travelled
over the land making careful drawings. He made the map
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
for the King or other official of government, for mariners or
merchants, or for people like ourselves who are curious about
life on the land. These maps suggest the life of the colonists,
and their architecture, as will be seen.</p>
<p>The study of North Carolina maps has been facilitated by
a recent book, <i>The Southeast in Early Maps</i>, by William P.
Cumming. Mr. Cumming, a professor at Davidson College,
spent many years searching for maps in the libraries of our
country and Europe. Much of the information and inspiration
for this booklet comes from his work.</p>
<p>One point before we begin looking at maps&mdash;words are
often &ldquo;misspelled.&rdquo; This happens because some words (as
Indian names) were new and spelling had to be invented for
them. There are other reasons, the most appealing one being
that eighteenth-century writers enjoyed a freedom about
spelling.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, &ldquo;A New &amp; Accurate Map of North ... Carolina...&rdquo;
is a detail from a map of southeastern North
America, &ldquo;drawn from late Surveys ... by Eman. Bowen.&rdquo;
This map was included in a geography book which Bowen
published in London in 1747. The scale of our illustration
is slightly smaller than that of the original map.</p>
<p>The map gives a grand and sober image of the New World.
In the west are the great &ldquo;Charokee Mountains.&rdquo; Individual
peaks are shaded on one side, making them seem massive
and solid as they thrust up forcibly from the land. At the
eastern side of the range are little trees, delicate signs of
green timber growth. Big letters tell us that &ldquo;Virginia&rdquo; is at
the north, &ldquo;North Carolina&rdquo; is in the middle area, and
&ldquo;South&rdquo; indicates the beginning of South Carolina, below.
A meandering, dotted line bounds North Carolina, which
was not considered as extensive then, as it is today.</p>

CAROLINA,&rdquo; LONDON, 1747.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>In the middle and upper part of the map many rivers
begin their courses to the sea. Six or seven of them may be
counted. They fan out as they flow onward, the upper ones
moving to the east, the lower ones more to the south. Fatter
and wider they become, finally creating Albemarle Sound,
&ldquo;Pamticoe&rdquo; Sound, and other features of the intricate shore
line. The sounds and wide river mouths provided good places
for small ships to land and for towns to be established. Light
vessels could push far up some of the rivers, and farmers and
planters along the banks could ship from their own private
docks.</p>
<p>This seaboard area is densely labeled with names of places,
an indication of the extensive settlement of the region.
Follow down the coast, and one finds Edenton, Bath Town,
New Bern, Beaufort Town, and farther to the south are
Wilmington and Brunswick Town. All these places were
founded well within the first half of the 18th century. Those
who spend vacations at Topsail Beach, Hatteras, Ocracoke,
and other Carolina beaches, will be surprised at the number
of such places which had already been given their names by
1747. To the west of our map are unfamiliar Indian names
of forts and settlements. Others have English-sounding
names. This map of 1747 does not show towns like Hillsboro
and Halifax, founded in the 1750&rsquo;s, nor towns farther west,
like Salem, Salisbury, and Charlotte, founded in the 1760&rsquo;s.
In studying early maps like this, one can feel the westward
growth of North Carolina in colonial times.</p>
<p>Since the map is rather small, it does not show all of the
settlements which did exist at its time, 1747. For example,
Campbell Town, which later became part of Fayetteville, is
not shown. Our mapmaker, Mr. Bowen, was too high in the
air, so to speak, to note this place and hundreds of individual
farms. To see in greater detail the richness of life on the land
below, we will descend lower in our next map.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 2. ALBEMARLE SOUND REGION, FROM &ldquo;MAP OF NORTH AND SOUTH
CAROLINA....&rdquo; MOUZON, 1775.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, the Albemarle Sound region, is a detail from a
famous map of North and South Carolina by Henry Mouzon,
Jr., made in 1775. Like the previous map, it was printed in
England and is also reproduced in slightly smaller size than
the original. Mr. Cumming states that it may be called the
Revolutionary War map of North and South Carolina, because
it was used by American, British and French forces.
So, in looking at the fragment, reproduced here, a person
might imagine that he is a Revolutionary War general,
studying the little towns, the ports, and roads that wander
through the country, and try to understand why a town is
where it is, what military importance it has, or how it might
be protected or destroyed.</p>
<p>Through Albemarle Sound runs a dotted line indicating
the course for ships. It may be seen where they could escape
to or enter from the Atlantic through the narrow, hazardous
Roanoke Inlet.</p>
<p>At the left, near where the Chowan River empties into
the Sound, is the town of Edenton. Several roads came together
here, and the little black rectangles suggest buildings.
There is a church in the town, with a tower and steeple in
front. Other churches shown elsewhere on the map have
exactly the same form as the one at Edenton, so one realizes
that this form is not meant to show what a specific church
looked like, but is a standard symbol for a church. Incidentally,
notice how churches or chapels stand alone at various
places in the countryside.</p>
<p>Courthouses, like churches, are shown in towns, and here
and there in the country. They are indicted by a symbol
which could be described as a letter &ldquo;U&rdquo; which is squared
rather than rounded. The courthouse at Edenton is hard to
identify; one can not be sure about it.</p>
<p>To the northeast of Edenton, on the Perquimans River, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the town of <i>Hartford</i>, now called Hertford. Farther to the
east is Nixonton, its houses lying along both sides of a single
road. Follow the road to the south and see the farms which
lie along Little River. Each farm is marked by a spot representing
the house, and carries the name of the owner&mdash;the
names Morris, Evans, Ancoup, and so on, can be read.
In the north, above this area, is the Great Dismal Swamp,
looking very great and dismal indeed.</p>
<p>Vivid as this map proves to be, we have not seen individual
towns very clearly. To get sharper ideas about them, we
descend lower to the earth and look at maps of individual
towns.</p>
<h3>MAPS OF COLONIAL TOWNS&mdash;TOWN PLANS</h3>
<p>A map of a town shows streets and broad avenues crossing
and interlacing in some pattern, wide or narrow lots in rows
along streets, and buildings which are placed at the front or
deep within the lots. Such matters make one section of a town
look different from another and are part of the design or the
<i>plan</i> of a town.</p>
<p>Lewis Mumford, a man who has a great interest in cities
and towns and who has written a number of books on them,
considers a town as a work of art. He believes that just as a
picture is a work of art, and a house is a work of art, so is
a town. The design of a town&mdash;the arrangement of streets
and lots&mdash;expresses the ideas of the people about the right
framework in which a good life can be lived.</p>
<p>For our study of colonial towns we are fortunate in having
beautiful maps of ten North Carolina towns, all made by the
surveyor Claude Joseph Sauthier. The Hillsboro map, <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>,
is one of these drawings. Sauthier traveled over North
Carolina between 1768 and 1770, surveyed and made maps
of Bath, Beaufort, Brunswick, Edenton, Cross Creek (now
Fayetteville), Halifax, Hillsboro, New Bern, Salisbury, and
Wilmington. The drawings were commissioned by Governor
Tryon; most of them have found their way to the great
British Museum, in London.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img" id="ill3">
<img id="fig3" src="images/p005.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="738" />
<p class="pcap">FIGURE 3. SAUTHIER&rsquo;S &ldquo;PLAN OF ... HILLSBOROUGH,&rdquo; 1768.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The majority of the buildings shown on the maps have
disappeared. The maps thus enable us to see&mdash;what otherwise
we could never see&mdash;North Carolina towns as they once were.
Sauthier did make occasional mistakes; and some details (for
example, the design of a flower garden) are not to be read as
literal fact; but for the most part the drawings may be studied
as aerial photographs. By great good fortune they were made
at the right time for us, and have survived.</p>
<p>To get some general ideas about colonial towns, we will
look at the map of Hillsboro. Our remarks about this map
reflect observations of Dr. Mary Claire Engstrom, scholar of
18th-century subjects, and a vice-president of the Hillsboro
Historical Society. The Sauthier map of Hillsboro, dated
October 1768, was made after the spring uprising of the
Regulators in that town and immediately following Governor
Tryon&rsquo;s arrival there in September. From this it may be
suspected that, in commissioning the map, Governor Tryon
had military thoughts in mind. Hillsboro&mdash;the danger spot&mdash;was
the first map in Sauthier&rsquo;s series of ten maps. The others
were made as he travelled with Governor Tryon.</p>
<p>The little town is shown on the Eno River in the wooded
land of Orange County. The big star at upper left shows
north, south, east, and west, and one notes that the town
seems to be laid out &ldquo;properly&rdquo; on these directions. Roads
leading to neighboring towns are carefully marked. There
are the Roads from Salisbury ... to Virginia ... to Halifax
... to New Bern ... to the Quaker Settlement ... to Cross
Creek. At lower left is &ldquo;Oakaneetche Mountain,&rdquo; a great
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
hump of earth overlooking Hillsboro. Another of the
Occoneechee mountains is seen at the edge of the map. The
Occoneechee Indians were one of several Indian tribes in
the area. Today, boy scouts in this part of Orange County
belong to the Occoneechee Council. They sometimes have
camporees at the Hillsboro race ground, not far from the
&ldquo;Race Ground&rdquo; marked on our map. This Race Ground lies
neatly within a bend in the Eno River, as though the river
wanted to mark out this area of flat land for such special use.
Scattered here and there outside the town are farms. The
rectangular plots of farm land are clearly marked, and the
farm houses and secondary buildings are placed at corners
convenient to the road.</p>
<p>For a better view of the actual town itself we look at an
enlarged section of the map, <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. Buildings are indicated
by small rectangles which have heavy outlines on two sides&mdash;the
right side and the lower side. These two heavy lines
may be regarded as a shadow cast by the bulk of the building.
They are a convention used by Sauthier to show bulk or
mass. The various rectangles which are shown within gardens
also employ this same thick-thin line convention, suggesting
a mass of green foliage rising above the surrounding paths.</p>
<p>The buildings marked &ldquo;A,&rdquo; ... &ldquo;B,&rdquo; ... &ldquo;C,&rdquo; and so on,
are identified under corresponding letters listed under &ldquo;Reference&rdquo;
at the upper right of the total map. &ldquo;A, Church&rdquo; is
toward the northern part of the town, removed from the
business area below. In assigning to the Church the &ldquo;A&rdquo;
(number one) position on his list, Sauthier pays respect to
the idea of the primacy of the spiritual order over civil law.
At &ldquo;A&rdquo; is a rectangle containing a number of crosses. This
seems to suggest a fenced-off cemetery. One does not find an
actual church building, but a church did exist on this ground
shortly after Sauthier&rsquo;s visit.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 4. DETAIL FROM SAUTHIER&rsquo;S PLAN OF HILLSBOROUGH.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;B, Court House&rdquo; is located close to the crossing of two
wide streets&mdash;those two main streets from which roads lead off
to the other towns of the Colony. The courthouse was a
&ldquo;plain, barn-like structure.&rdquo; The present and very famous
Old Courthouse, dating from near the mid-19th century,
stands near this site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rdquo; marks the jail. The word <i>jail</i> used to be spelled <i>gaol</i>,
but Sauthier spells it <i>goal</i>. It is shown within a small rectangle,
perhaps indicating a fenced-in yard. The jail may
possibly have been a new structure, for Dr. Engstrom has discovered
that about six months before Sauthier&rsquo;s visit a former
jail, at another location down town, was sold to a private
individual to use for business purposes. The new jail was
probably not an impressive building, perhaps only a log
cabin, but Sauthier thought it important to note that the
town had this institution to take care of wayward people.
Incidentally, the jail seems a little wayward itself, having
strayed into the otherwise clear, wide street. When the jail
was built that street was perhaps just a well worn path, and
the jail may have been erected hastily without careful checking
of stakes for the street. In other colonial towns (for
example, in the placement of the church at Bath) it sometimes
seems as though buildings are incorrectly placed. The
Hillsboro jail, for many years in the general position shown,
has recently been moved back to a less assertive site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D, Market House,&rdquo; directly at the main intersection and
adjacent to the courthouse, is shown as square. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; inscribed
within this square perhaps indicates that the market
had a pyramidal, four-sided roof. The building may have
had open sides, like markets in certain other colonial towns.
The open market building is an idea brought from Europe.
Other buildings around this main intersection were stores or
warehouses. At the southwest corner was Johnston and
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Thackston&rsquo;s store where Edmund Fanning, the Clerk of
Court and a Tory leader, took refuge from the Regulators in
1770.</p>
<p>At &ldquo;E, Mills&rdquo; there are curious parallel straight lines which
can be read as canals. The mills, probably with water wheels,
are built over the canals. Where the river widens out at the
left there may have been a dam to hold back the flow of water
in the river, and force it through the canals. The curious
marks on the canals could be gates.</p>
<p>The mills are the last structures identified on the map.
Sauthier does not mention the Commons, a field set aside for
pasturing of the cattle owned by people in a colonial town.
On some of his other maps he identifies such places as Tann
Yard, ... School House, ... Tobacco Store, ... Windmill.</p>
<p>The homes shown in the map are all built near the street.
Behind are fields or gardens divided into orderly plots. Most
of the buildings are simple rectangles in shape. Occasionally
a building has an irregular shape, perhaps meaning that an
original rectangular structure was given an addition. Similarly,
lots with irregular shape may indicate additions or subdivision
of an original tract.</p>
<p>By way of contrast to the Hillsboro town plan, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> is
a drawing of Grenoble, a medieval French city. This drawing
is reproduced from <i>The Culture of Cities</i>, by Lewis Mumford.
The winding streets are natural paths that have become
fixed as streets. Some curving streets mark the location of
early town walls, removed as the town grew and as larger
encircling walls were erected. Mr. Mumford speaks of this
kind of town as having a natural circular plan, with
irregular blocks dictated by topography and the original circular
wall.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>When American colonial towns like Hillsboro were
founded, the streets and lots were laid out in advance. The
uniform rectangular lots were easy to measure and ideal for
fixing sale prices and for the assessment of taxes. Later expansion
of the town could also be orderly. The idea of the
colonial gridiron town speaks of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; men and their
institutions, as opposed to medieval men.</p>
<p>Figures <a href="#fig6">6</a>, <a href="#fig7">7</a>, and <a href="#fig8">8</a> suggest planning ideas found in early
North Carolina towns. <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, recalling Hillsboro, could
be called a plan for an inland town. In our diagram two
slightly wider streets mark a crossing at the center of the
town. The dot in the center of the crossing is to indicate the
placement of the courthouse. Such placement is not what we
saw at Hillsboro, but is shown on several of the Sauthier maps
of North Carolina towns (for example, Salisbury and Wilmington).
This was a good arrangement, for the courthouse,
symbol of the civil law and order of the area, might be seen
from a long way off as the town was approached from various
directions. However, the early towns which began with the
courthouse astride the main crossing generally found later
that this location impeded the flow of traffic. Consequently,
some courthouses have been moved from their original sites,
allowing traffic to flow across the intersection. Pittsboro,
however&mdash;although a relatively late colonial town, having
been laid out in 1785&mdash;still has its courthouse in the central
position.</p>
<p><a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, to suggest the plan of a port town, seems like
half of the inland plan, above. A principal street of the town
runs along or near the water. It might be called Water
Street, as at Bath.</p>
<p><a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> indicates an idea found at Salem, laid out in
1765, and elsewhere in the American colonies. A central
square is left open and principal town buildings are built
around it. At Raleigh, laid out in 1792, the square is very
large, and contains the State Capitol. A central green belonging
to the people, a place in which they might gather,
is still a pleasant reminder of community life and order in
those towns which possess them.</p>

<p>Since colonial days our old towns have changed much.
In the 19th century mills and warehouses dwarfed the original
buildings. The railroad, that glamorous invention of
the industrial revolution, appeared in the towns, bisecting
them. Especially in the 20th century, faster change and
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; have all but obliterated the charm of old towns.
Downtown streets become impossibly congested. Old residential
areas are invaded by filling stations and supermarkets.
In a free country a man can buy a beautiful old home, blast
it out of existence, and erect an unsightly factory over its
ruins. Such &ldquo;progress&rdquo; has blighted and disfigured many
towns. But townspeople are becoming horrified by this, and
now there are citizen committees which bring about zoning
laws under which the plans for the use of land and for new
buildings must be approved. Some towns have Planning
Boards, with a Planning Director in charge, who think not
only of the present but also of the far future. At the University
of North Carolina there is a Department of City and
Regional Planning; it trains young men and women for positions
in planning.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 9. CONJECTURAL SKETCH OF THE PALMER HOUSE, BATH.</p>
</div>
<p>After looking at maps of North Carolina and its towns,
we visit a colonial home to see what it is like. The Palmer-Marsh
house in Bath is chosen for this purpose because it
offers exceptional possibilities for the kind of visit we want
to make.</p>
<p><a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> is a sketch of the big, sturdy house, its out-buildings,
orchard, and gardens which, taken together, look like
a self-sufficient farm. Our sketch of the surroundings is an
estimate, based on the plan of the &ldquo;Col. Palmer&rdquo; property
seen in Sauthier&rsquo;s 1769 map of Bath (<a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>). The map
shows the Palmer property &ldquo;down town&rdquo; on Water, or Main
Street, which runs along Bath Creek, the house being placed
directly on this business thoroughfare. The front room of
the house was planned for business purposes, and so it has
its own door to the street. Thus the chimney, which ordinarily
would have been on this end wall, has been moved around
the corner to the side. The house, thought to have been built
in 1744, was sold to Colonel Palmer in 1764, just a few
years before Sauthier came to Bath.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Of the four out-buildings in a group, a well house is in
the foreground. The drawing shows the well covered by a
square, open-sided structure with pyramidal or hipped roof.
The other square building with hipped roof is a smoke
house&mdash;where meat was hung and smoked. A smoke house
which exists today on the property is thought to contain the
wood frame of this original structure. Of the two out-buildings
with ordinary gable roofs, one could be a dairy and the
other a barn. At the back of the property are the extensive
gardens and the orchard&mdash;represented in such charming
fashion on Sauthier&rsquo;s map. We know that in 1911 the yard
of the house was full of pear, apple, and other fruit trees,
the descendants, perhaps, of the original trees in the orchard.</p>
<p>In the 19th century porches were added to the house
(<a href="#fig11">figure 11</a>); but the porches have recently been removed
during a project to restore the house to what it originally was
(<a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>). The juxtaposition of these two photographs
brings the above ideas forcibly to our attention. It is important
to know that almost every colonial house has undergone
changes during the years, and to know the meaning of
conscientious restoration.</p>
<p>In the 19th century the house was &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; in several
ways. The porches were a very natural addition, especially
for hot Carolina summers. The shutters were removed because
they were considered archaic. In the windows the
small 18th century panes of glass were replaced by larger
panes available in the 19th century. Also, the street fa&ccedil;ade of
the house was made more up-to-date, as can be seen. The
gable projects emphatically and has two horizontal strips
at the lower corners. The gable suggests (vaguely) a pediment
on a Greek or Roman temple. (A <i>pediment</i> is the low
triangular gable end of a classical temple). Note that the
supports of the side porch also are classical; they are clean,
elegant Doric columns. The classical ideas mentioned above
were popular in the post-colonial period.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>By contrast, the restored house of today is much closer to
what is characteristic of the earlier 18th century in North
Carolina. The whole street fa&ccedil;ade of the house registers in
the viewer&rsquo;s mind as one simple plane, without strong overhang
at the top, and without any suggestion of a classical
pediment. It is interesting to note that the design and color
of the restored shutters are based on one old red shutter
found in the attic of the house.</p>
<p><a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a> shows the back of the house, with its famous
double chimney, an unusual feature rarely found. The windows
in the chimney give light to closets on the first and
second floors. In the plan of the first floor, <a href="#fig14">figure 14</a>, it may
be seen how a closet is placed between two bedrooms, serving
one of them. On the floor above, the closet serves the bedrooms
on the other side, thus demonstrating a desire to play
fair with bedrooms on both sides of the house.</p>
<p>At the front of the house is the room planned for business.
At various times through the years it was used for store,
courtroom, and parlor. In the center of the house is a large
hall room; it has two outside doors, and an open stairway
to the second floor. The dotted line (&middot;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&middot;) indicates a great,
central beam used in the construction of the house, having
the exceptional length of 51 feet. The dashed line (-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-) indicates
the former location of a partition; the back bedrooms
were lengthened at the expense of the hall. In the recent
restoration of the house the location of the original partition
was discovered, and it has been restored.</p>
<p>If one compares the plan of the house in <a href="#fig14">figure 14</a> with that
shown on the Sauthier map, <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>, it is seen at once that
the general proportions are not the same. Sauthier made a
mistake; he got the main facts, but was unable to take time
to measure every single building he showed.</p>

and, parallel with it, the beam at the side wall. Notice also
that the side entrance door is framed at the right by a post
which rises to the ceiling. Such exposed beams and posts
suggest the wood skeleton of the house. Skeletal structure is
concealed in most colonial homes that remain today, but is
found occasionally as here in the Palmer house. More will
be said later about exposed construction and about interiors.</p>

<p>Our visit to the Palmer house has provided a glimpse into
modern, careful restoration. The house was restored by the
Historic Bath Commission, in co-operation with The Beaufort
County Historical Society, and with assistance from the

<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Archives and History. The restoration project included much
more work than we have shown. For example, archaeological
study of old foundations in the yard around the house revealed
various uses of the basement and the existence of a
19th-century outside dining room and kitchen, as was common
during this later time.</p>

<br />Kinds of Construction</h2>

</div>
<p class="center"><i><span class="large">Log Houses, Houses with a Wooden Frame, Brick and Stone Houses</span></i></p>
<p>Much of the special charm of a colonial home lies in its
structure so quaint and different from the construction used
in homes of our day. Some colonial homes are &ldquo;log cabins,&rdquo;
others have a wooden frame or skeleton, and still others are
made of brick or stone. Sometimes a builder could choose
his materials and kind of construction. At other times and
places a builder had little or no choice of materials and was
limited to using the simplest tools and construction methods.
In order to understand the meaning of colonial architecture
one looks carefully at structure.</p>
<h3>LOG HOUSES</h3>
<p>We begin our study with log houses because they seem the
simplest of the several kinds of construction. Log homes or
&ldquo;log cabins&rdquo; were not built by the first colonists, however.
It is true that such houses had been built in northern European
countries since very early times, but this type of construction
was not introduced in the colonies for houses until
late in the 17th century. From that time on, log homes were
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
continuously built in the colonies for pioneer cabins, barns,
outdoor kitchens, and other simple structures. In colonial
times log construction was also used for jails, forts, and for
the first courthouses. We shall note a number of designs for
log houses and the various ways in which logs were cut
and joined together.</p>
<p>The illustration on <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a> gives the flavor and the feeling
of the pioneer log cabin. This drawing of a cabin near Fayetteville
is from a travel book, <i>A Journey in the Slave States,
1856</i>, written by Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted, who won
fame as the designer of Central Park, in New York City, was
also interested in traveling and seeing how people lived and
how they built homes. The drawing shows how the logs fit
together at the comers, each log being notched so that it locks
with the other logs above and below. The chimney is also
made of logs&mdash;or, rather, of small sticks&mdash;and is plastered inside
with mud. The open spaces between the big logs of the
house should also be filled or chinked with mud, but Mr.
Olmsted observed that they were not. The roof, it will be
noticed, is covered with huge shingles, or shakes.</p>
<p>Although there are many log cabins in North Carolina,
most of those from the colonial period have disappeared. The
Britten Sanders log cabin in Southern Pines (figures <a href="#fig16">16</a> and
<a href="#fig17">17</a>), is a well-known example which has survived. It is more
elegant than the cabin seen in the preceding sketch. The
round logs have been somewhat squared-off. The great chimney
is of stone. The roof extends far out on the chimney
side to protect clay mortar in the chimney from rain. The
clay mortar as well as the clay chinking between the logs
has now been replaced with cement for permanence. In the
restored chimney it may be observed how the cement does
not extend flush to the outside surface. Instead, it is kept
deep within the stones in imitation of clay mortar which has
partially washed away.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The Sanders cabin is a restoration project of the Moore
County Historical Association. The Association took the cabin
from its original country site and moved it to Southern Pines.
The chimney had fallen down, but the stones were picked
up and are used in the present chimney. The cabin is on the
grounds of the Shaw house, an early 19th-century home. It
seems appropriate that the old cabin should be sited on the
property of the later house, for this was the practice of the
early settlers. After out-growing their first cabin home, they
would build a larger house, continuing to utilize the original
cabin for cooking, weaving, and other purposes.</p>
<p>In the close-up photograph of the door and wall of the
cabin may be seen a latch cord hanging from the door. A
row of rafter ends shows just above the door. One rafter end
is missing on the right; this marks the point where an inside
stair rose to the loft. The present stair and the flooring of
the cabin were taken from another old house.</p>
<p>The Blair-McCormack house, near High Point (figures
<a href="#fig18">18</a>, <a href="#fig19">19</a> and <a href="#fig20">20</a>), presents some further ideas about log houses.
This building is the Enos Blair log cabin, constructed around
1750, later enlarged, and now the Jimmy McCormack house.
The original cabin is surrounded by porches front and back,
and additions on the left and right sides. At first glance the
house seems quite recent and unremarkable; old log houses
do not always reveal themselves in first casual view.</p>
<p>The logs of the cabin are joined as shown in the sketch,
<a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>. This joint shows brilliant structural development
beyond the simple saddle joint seen in previous examples.
The craftsman who chopped the squared log ends had great
skill as he cut the intricate geometrical teeth which lock
together so securely and accurately. One can imagine him at
work:&mdash;he would cut a joint and lay the log in place. If the
joint fit&mdash;fine. If it did not quite fit, he would remove the
log and make further necessary cuts. This type of joint sheds
water very well.</p>

</div>
<p>Because of the side additions to the Enos Blair cabin, nowhere
around the present house can one see two outside walls
as shown in our sketch. However, other cabins in North
Carolina do show the complete joint as drawn.</p>
<p>The plan of the original cabin is given in <a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>. It
shows what we have not seen before, a chimney completely
inside of the house. The chimney, thus protected from rain,
is laid with clay mortar. A narrow stairway at one side of
the chimney winds up to the loft above. On this stairway the
visitor is face to face with the great chimney, and can scoop
out a sample of &ldquo;mortar&rdquo; with his finger nail, proving that
the stones were indeed laid in clay.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>, the Gregg Cabin, in the mountains of Caldwell
County, is a further example of beautiful craftsmanship. The
photograph shows changes that time has brought to the original
house, but attention should be focussed on the lower
walls in the foreground. Here the logs have been cut down
to great planks, and so squarely cut that chinking seems almost
unnecessary. The design of the corner joint, simpler than
that of the Enos Blair cabin, is called &ldquo;dove tail&rdquo;&mdash;each plank
ends with a shape something like the tail of a dove.</p>
<p>Figures <a href="#fig22">22</a> and <a href="#fig23">23</a> show designs for double cabins&mdash;two
cabins under one roof. The first idea, called the <i>Saddle-Bag</i>
cabin, has two rooms attached to one central chimney. This
plan gets its name because it resembles two saddle bags hanging
over the back of a horse.</p>
<p>The second design, called the <i>Dog-Run</i>, has a chimney
on each end, and an open breezeway&mdash;or dog run&mdash;through
the center. This plan is also known as the <i>&rsquo;Possum Trot</i>. No
doubt the design was a favorite for large families, for it
provided an out door play area for children in good weather
and bad.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Look back at the Gregg cabin (<a href="#fig21">figure 21</a>); by study of its
roof line the plan of the cabin can be understood and named.</p>
<p>Both the Saddle-Bag and the Dog-Run plans are simple&mdash;just
two cabins under one long roof. It seems appropriate
therefore, that they should be of simple log construction.</p>
<p><a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a> is the John Knox cabin in Rowan County, built
about 1752 but recently destroyed by fire. This illustration
shows interesting developments in design. At first glance the
structure does not seem to be a log house at all, but rather
a medium sized clapboard house with a porch cut into one
corner. But where the clapboards have been torn away one
may see chinked log construction underneath. On the surface
of this inner wall are vertical strips to which the clapboard
siding is nailed. It is not uncommon for log structures
to disappear beneath siding added at some later date. With
the John Knox cabin we know the siding was added <i>after</i> the
porch and shed because the siding sweeps without break
across the whole side of the structure.</p>
<p>Olmsted noted this kind of cabin on his travels in South
Carolina and was very appreciative of its features, which he
described in some detail. In cabins of the better type, he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The roof is usually built with a curve, so as to project eight or
ten feet beyond the log wall; and a part of this space, exterior to
the logs, is inclosed with boards, making an additional small room,&mdash;the
remainder forms an open porch. The whole cabin is often
elevated on four corner posts, two or three feet from the ground,
so that air may circulate under it.... The porch has a railing in
front.... The logs are usually hewn but little, and, of course, as
they are laid up, there will be wide interstices between them. They
are commonly not &lsquo;chinked&rsquo; or filled up in any way; nor is the
wall lined inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>That such cabins were indeed of a better class becomes painfully
clear when Olmsted adds a note about the cabins of
poorer people. These cabins were &ldquo;mere pens of logs, roofed
over, provided with a chimney, and usually with a shed of
boards, supported by rough posts before the door.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>WOODEN FRAME HOUSES</h3>
<p>Houses with wooden frames or skeletons were built in
North Carolina long before the log houses seen above. Framed
houses represent a tradition of building dating from medieval
times which the colonists brought from Europe.</p>
<p>The earliest framed houses in the South have disappeared
almost without a trace, but scholars are able to form general
ideas about their nature. For example, <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>, showing
several kinds of framed houses, is from Henry Formans&rsquo; book,
<i>Architecture in the Old South</i>. The drawing depicts the kind
of wall surfaces which might possibly have been seen in
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Jamestown, Virginia, very early in the 17th century. All the
houses are of wooden frame construction, either exposed or
covered. Houses with framework exposed are called &ldquo;half-timbered.&rdquo;
From left to right in the drawing the houses are
described as follows:&mdash;half-timber work with brick filling;
plaster; weatherboarding or clapboards; half-timber work
with plaster; and tile-hung. Several of the houses have a projecting
second story. All have steep roofs. Windows are
of the hinged casement type, with small pieces of diagonally
set glass.</p>
<p>Houses of this general sort&mdash;especially those with exposed
wooden frame and projecting second story&mdash;are frequently
shown in illustrations in European history books. In England
they are called Jacobean, because of their association with
the Jacobean period in 17th-century England which followed
the Tudor era.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 26. THE BROTHERS HOUSE IN SALEM.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>As the 17th century gave way to the 18th, the &ldquo;medieval&rdquo;
open-framed house was generally supplanted by the house
with clapboard siding, like the third house in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>.
This wall surface offered better protection against rain and
cold winds than the open-frame house which leaked on all
sides. In the 18th century the use of a projecting second story
was discontinued. Larger panes of glass for windows became
available in the 18th century, and sliding sash windows, like
those noted in the Palmer house, came into general use.</p>
<p>Almost all of the medieval open-frame structures in
America have disappeared, but North Carolina still has a
remarkable example in the Brothers House in Salem (<a href="#fig26">figure 26</a>).
Those who have visited Salem in past years may be
surprised to learn this and to see the strange-looking building
in our sketch, for they recall no such structure. Instead, the
Brothers House is remembered as a simple clapboard building.
However, the house was built originally as in our
sketch; the clapboards, added in the early 19th century, are
currently being removed and the house restored to its original
character.</p>
<p>Salem and the Brothers House date from near the end of
the colonial period&mdash;a time long after colonial builders had
generally abandoned the earlier, medieval construction.
However, we show the Brothers House because it calls up
for us the earlier colonial period with houses now destroyed
and forgotten, built in such construction.</p>
<p>The town of Old Salem is a show place in North Carolina,
one of those few towns anywhere in our country where a
whole early settlement is preserved. Salem was established in
1766 by members of a religious group, the Moravians, who
planned their town and their life quite differently from other
settlers. For example, the Brothers House, built in 1769, was
a place for unmarried men to live and to work at carpentry,
pottery and other trades, and to teach these trades. The
house is one of several early structures in Salem built in the
medieval way with open timber construction or with wood
framework covered by plaster. The builders were aware that
wood siding would have given better protection, but it was
&ldquo;the most expensive method of surfacing a house&rdquo; according
to a Salem report of 1768. Therefore, some of the early
houses were built in the older way. The curious apron roof
encircling the walls above the first story somewhat protected
the lower walls from rain and also provided a sheltered path
for pedestrians.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>In 1786 the house was given a brick addition on the left,
and around 1800 was plastered over. Perhaps at this time the
apron roof was removed. The plastering was apparently not
successful, for in 1826 the weatherboard siding was added
and remained until its recent removal.</p>
<p>The photograph, <a href="#fig27">figure 27</a>, was taken in the summer of
1962; it shows a workman removing the siding of 1826. The
skeleton of the house is made of great squarish timbers. Toward
the right of the photograph may be seen the wooden
pegs which hold the timbers together. Bricks are cut as
necessary to fit within the wooden framework. The photograph
suggests a question which visitors ask:&mdash;what holds the
brick panels in place and prevents them from falling out?
The explanation is simple and shows the cleverness of the
designers. The brick panels fit into frames that have been
slightly hollowed out on their inner sides. Through the
window one has a glimpse of an inside wall. It has exposed
timber construction too.</p>
<p>In discussing Old Salem we should note plans for opening
a new museum, the Museum of Southern Decorative
Arts. The museum will contain a series of rooms secured
from 18th- and 19th-century homes. This is a new kind of
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
museum for the South and is another reason for visiting
Salem.</p>
<p>Elsewhere than Old Salem all the surviving wooden-frame
colonial homes in North Carolina have wooden siding. They
were probably planned from the start to have this &ldquo;modern&rdquo;
siding, and hence their skeleton construction was not quite
like that in the Brothers House. In order to get an idea of
what the new construction was like, we look at <a href="#fig28">Figure 28</a>. This
is the structure previously examined, the Palmer house, during
reconstruction. The photograph was taken after the later
porch was removed, thus exposing the original wooden
frame of the house.</p>
<p>At first glance one might take this to be a 20th century
house, with vertical studs and horizontal laths to which
plaster has been applied from the inside. Drips of wet plaster
show clearly in the photograph. However, a closer look
shows that the variously sized and irregularly placed wood
members come from an age before factory-cut 2 &times; 4&rsquo;s. Nevertheless,
the preponderance of vertical studs does suggest that
the builder had a clear idea of &ldquo;stud construction&rdquo; in mind.
The studs provide a good nailing surface for the laths inside
and the clapboards outside. To speculate on this design is to
be dazzled by its beauty and simplicity. The builder must
have felt that he was really living in a modern age.</p>
<p>Looking further at the photograph one may visualize the
craftsman at work, cutting and fitting his wood together in
ingenious ways. At the left is a great vertical post which rises
through two stories. It is notched on right and left to hold
the horizontal beam which passes behind it. These two members
are locked together by wooden pegs. The doors is framed
by two thick posts, with two light studs between. The window
above the door is also framed by thick posts. But because
the window is narrower than the door, it requires only one
stud between its posts. At the right, a large post is braced by
diagonal sticks, one on either side. This post corresponds to
the post noted on far left, but that post was made of one long
piece of wood, and this one is made of two pieces. Details
such as these suggest that the builder &ldquo;played it by ear&rdquo;&mdash;decided
upon joints and bracing as he went along.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p><a href="#fig29">Figure 29</a> is inserted here to suggest the variety of clever
ways in which colonial craftsmen fitted wood pieces together.
Such junctions are called mortise and tenon joints. They are
cut with a chisel and mallet. One can well imagine the satisfaction
derived by the craftsman in deciding upon the particular
kind of joint to cut. When the two pieces fitted together
perfectly, a hole was drilled through them with an
auger, a peg was cut and driven into the hole, and the proud
workman moved on to the next joint. Sometimes, in details
such as windows and cabinets, the pegs are as narrow in diameter
as the lead in a pencil, but are fitted so perfectly that
one must look hard to find them.</p>
<p><a href="#fig30">Figure 30</a> concerns the attic of a colonial house. This
diagram shows the fascinating mortised and pegged joints
on display at the Sloop Point house, which will be mentioned
later. At floor level a rafter is cut and locked with a floor
beam. At the ridge of the roof two rafters are beautifully
mortised and pegged together.</p>
<p>When visiting an old house, it is often rewarding to ask
the owner what he knows about its construction details.
Sometimes under a stairway or along a damaged plaster wall
one may see into the skeletal structure. Walls are not always
hollow as in the Palmer house; sometimes they are filled with
brick or clay bats, thus recalling medieval construction. Basements,
as well as attics, are good places in which to find hewn
joints. On the outside of a house the trim at the corners and
at the roof should be studied. The problem on the outside
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
is <i>water</i>&mdash;rain water which may get into the ends of a piece
of wood, or into joints, thus causing rotting. This problem
should be kept in mind when examining the trim on a house;
colonial builders were very aware of it.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 31. THE CUPOLA HOUSE, EDENTON</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig31">Figure 31</a>, the Cupola House in Edenton, is one of the
oldest remaining wooden frame houses in North Carolina. It
is famous for its exterior with cupola and overhanging second
story, and for its interior rooms, lavishly carved. Sauthier&rsquo;s
map of Edenton clearly shows the house facing its own wharf
on the bay, a fine view of which can still be had from the
cupola. The house is dated between 1724, when Richard
Sanderson purchased the lot &ldquo;unimproved,&rdquo; and 1726, when
he sold the lot with a house on it. Toward mid-century another
owner installed the carved interiors. At present the
building serves as the Edenton Public Library.</p>
<p>The overhanging second story supported on brackets recalls
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
the sketches of 17th-century houses previously seen, and
the Cupola House has been praised as the finest framed
Jacobean house in the South. Our photograph, taken some
years ago, shows scalloped shingles around the cupola and
ordinary shingles on the roof. The latter are replacements,
for, of course, houses have to be reshingled at intervals. Since
this photograph was taken the Cupola House has been reshingled
completely with scalloped shingles in an effort to
restore the original appearance of the roof.</p>
<h3>BRICK AND STONE HOUSES</h3>
<p>A few early 18th-century brick houses remain in
North Carolina. They exhibit a special kind of shimmering
beauty. <a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a>, the Jordan farm house, near Windsor,
thought to have been built in 1713, is one of the earliest of
these houses. It burned in the 1920&rsquo;s, and its new dormers
and wood details are not of colonial design, but the original
brick mass of the house has been preserved to be seen and
enjoyed. The brick surface has a sparkle, a checkerboarding
of light and dark, which results from using bricks which are
glazed on their ends, but left unglazed on their sides. The
bricks are laid in courses in which ends (headers) alternate
with sides (stretchers). This system of laying brick is called
Flemish bond; it differs from the method used today in
which only the stretchers are exposed. The colonists presumably
felt that Flemish bond was strong and proper, and
they certainly were charmed by the appearance of the walls.</p>
<p>There is a further special effect to be noted in brick
houses such as the Jordan house. The chimneys are set inside
the wall, and so do not break the smooth outside surface of
the wall. The basement, although projecting slightly, is
made of the same stuff as the upper wall. Thus the whole
lower part of the house registers in one&rsquo;s mind as a very clean,
rectilinear form placed directly on the ground. By contrast,
framed houses are more complicated in their geometry, with
brick chimneys projecting at the sides, and with brick foundations
showing in obvious contrast to clapboard walls.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 33. NEWBOLD-WHITE HOUSE, NEAR HERTFORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p><a href="#fig33">Figure 33</a>, the Newbold-White house near Hertford, is
also of the early 18th century, but is smaller and closer to the
ground than the Jordan farm. The wooden lean-to on the
right is a later addition. This side with three dormer windows
was once the front of the house. The base has been
plastered over, to protect the brick which at this level often
disintegrates.</p>
<p>This picture was made by the master photographer,
Frances Benjamin Johnston. It brings out the dazzling brick
surface of the old structure and other details of brickwork
design, such as the window tops set in gentle arches and the
horizontal line which runs across the end wall. This line is a
shadow cast by two slightly projecting courses of brick and
marks the division between first and second floors; on the
inside, the offset courses provide a ledge on which to lay floor
beams.</p>
<p>Brick, as may be inferred from above, was used in a number
of structural and decorative ways; some are suggested in
<a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>. Flemish bond (<a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>a</i>) we have already noted.
English bond (<a href="#fig34">34</a><i>b</i>) has courses entirely of stretchers alternating
with courses entirely of headers. This bonding
system is illustrated in chimneys from the Palmer house,
<a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>, and from the Sloop Point house to be seen later.
Sometimes all the bricks in a course were set diagonally,
thus producing a remarkable accent line (<a href="#fig34">34</a><i>c</i>); or the square
ends of a row of bricks were molded or rubbed into curves
(<a href="#fig34">34</a><i>d</i>). In some brick houses remaining from the later 18th
century, as in the Salisbury area, bold and gay patterns were
created through use of glazed, and lighter and darker bricks
(<a href="#fig34">34</a><i>e</i>).</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 35. THE OLD BRICK HOUSE, ELIZABETH CITY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It may be supposed that masons enjoyed such improvisation,
just as woodworkers took pleasure in the design of
joints. When visiting a brick house and studying its details,
the mortar should be examined also. Sometimes it will be
found to contain bits of shells, for the colonists made an inferior
sort of lime by burning oyster and other shells.</p>
<p><a href="#fig35">Figure 35</a>, the Old Brick House, near Elizabeth City, demonstrates
that some colonial houses had chimney walls of
brick with front and back walls of wood. This well-known,
early 18th-century house stands on the Pasquotank River,
which can be seen in the illustration just beyond the house
on the right. Not a little of the fame of this beautiful house
comes from the legend that Blackbeard the pirate once lived
here, mooring his ships at his own landing, nearby.</p>
<p>Each face of the house is clearly symmetrical, bespeaking
the sense of balance which was so important to the 18th
century. The end walls are in Flemish bond; the walls of the
basement are of stone, the individual stones being like huge
pebbles, rounded by centuries of washing on some beach.
Such stones in colonial homes are often called &ldquo;ballast stones&rdquo;
because sometimes they were shipped over as ballast in
vessels from England and other shores. However, there is
some doubt that this was so in the case of the present house,
because it is unlikely that a ship in ballast could have sailed
into the shallow Pasquotank River.</p>
<p>The floor plan and the famous interiors of this house will
be discussed later in this booklet.</p>
<p>To be noted along with brick houses are a few stone houses
in the Piedmont, remaining from late colonial and early republican
times. <a href="#fig36">Figure 36</a>, the Michael Braun house, near
Salisbury, built between 1758 and 1766, is an impressive
example. Its orange-hued walls are two feet thick. Some years
ago the house was in poor condition, remove this phrase,
but was repaired by the Brown (Braun) family. It has now
been purchased by the Rowan Museum, Salisbury, and is
being restored by that organization.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 36. MICHAEL BROWN HOUSE, NEAR SALISBURY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Like so many of our early houses, the Braun house is
unusual in several ways. Immediately striking is the non-symmetrical
division of the stone fa&ccedil;ade, not at all like the
Old Brick House and other 18th-century houses. The wooden
structure at the right is the kitchen. In the kitchen is a
great fireplace along the stone wall of the house, with the
chimney containing ingenious flues to heat adjacent rooms
in the house. The kitchen is a restoration.</p>
<h3>ROOF IDEAS&mdash;GABLE, GAMBREL, AND HIPPED</h3>
<p>In discussing the structure of colonial homes we add
a note on the several kinds of roofs which were used. After a
builder had raised the masonry or wood walls of his house,
the roof was a major design and construction problem. The
type of roof selected represented what the builder thought
was good-looking and appropriate for his special needs.</p>
<p>Our diagram, <a href="#fig37">figure 37</a>, shows a <i>gable</i> roof on the left,
contrasted with a <i>gambrel</i> roof on the right, each type having
a dormer window to light the attic space thus making it more
pleasant and usable. The gable roof is simpler in construction,
and was the type most generally used in the colonies;
but our diagram suggests how it cramps free movement within
the attic. The gambrel roof, although calling for more
involved construction, affords more head room. Apart from
the space consideration, the gambrel roof is rather cheerful
and attractive when seen from the outside, a factor that may
have been responsible for the 18th-century fad for them.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 38.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Both the houses shown in the diagram are called &ldquo;story-and-a-half.&rdquo;
Neither has a full second story like the Palmer
house. Many believe that in colonial times the tax on story-and-a-half
houses was less than that on two-story houses, and
that for this reason people built the former type.</p>
<p><a href="#fig38">Figure 38</a> shows the <i>hipped</i> roof, in which four roof
planes, one on each side of the house, all slope back toward
the center above, thus shedding water from all sides. The
vertical walls of the house end in a top horizontal line which
extends uninterruptedly around the house. Thus the lower
part of the house, especially from the standpoint of the little
figure on the ground in the illustration, asserts itself as a
clean cube. In late colonial and early republican times this
effect was much appreciated by enthusiasts of &ldquo;modern art,&rdquo;
but home builders in the earlier 18th century did not show
enthusiasm for the hipped roof, perhaps because it reduced
the area of living space on the top floor. However, in early
18th-century public buildings, where an attic space was not
of great value, the impressive-looking hipped roof was
used. This type roof was used also on smoke houses and well
houses, as was seen in the Palmer house.</p>

</div>
<p class="center"><i><span class="large">The Study of Floor Plans</span></i></p>
<p>The construction schemes we have discussed up to this
point&mdash;for walls and roofs&mdash;have to do with the obvious appearance
of a house as it is seen from the outside. But the
floor plan of a structure is not such an immediate and recognizable
element. It is necessary to go inside a house and
wander about in it before one can begin to understand its
plan. The plan, however, was clearly in the mind of the
builder as he worked; for us, a clear image of the floor plan
is important for a full understanding of a building.</p>
<p>The reading of plans is a vivid, very real, architectural
experience. For example, let us look at <a href="#fig39">figure 39</a>, a simple
one-room cabin. The cabin is entered through one of the
doors&mdash;doors are indicated by a break in the contour line.
The heroic character of the great fireplace is sensed&mdash;the fireplace
and masonry walls are shown by heavy lines. Opposite
the fireplace is found a window&mdash;windows are shown by a
thin segment of contour line. As one walks up the stairs, turning
at the corner, the lines fade away as the level of another
floor is approached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The above experience began with lines on paper and ended
by &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the house in three-dimensional space. This
happens in reverse when a house is actually visited. As the
rooms through which one moves become more familiar,
gradually the floor plan takes shape. This plan can be retained
in the mind and can easily be drawn on paper. When
the plan is known, much thinking and talking about a building
can be done.</p>
<h3>SIMPLE FLOOR PLANS</h3>
<p>Figures <a href="#fig39">39</a> to <a href="#fig45">45</a> show a number of first floor plans found
in North Carolina colonial homes. <a href="#fig39">Figure 39</a>, which we have
already &ldquo;visited,&rdquo; begins the series with the simplest one-room
plan. It is something like the Blair cabin, already seen
(<a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>), except for the chimney built inside the house
in the earlier example. Both plans have stairs, but another
cabin might have only a ladder leading to the loft.</p>
<p><a href="#fig40">Figure 40</a> is a simple two-room plan. The larger room,
with the fireplace, is for family living. The smaller room, for
sleeping, would be cold in winter, but would receive some
warmth from the larger room.</p>
<p><a href="#fig41">Figure 41</a>, with three rooms, is called the Quaker plan or
the Penn plan because William Penn, the famous Quaker
founder of Philadelphia, recommended it to his colonists.
Quakers who came to North Carolina brought the plan with
them.</p>
<p><a href="#fig42">Figure 42</a> shows a center hall plan, a great advance toward
privacy and better living. The hall, as may be seen, permits
entry and movement in the house from one room to another
without using any room for passage. This is the plan of the
brick Newbold-White house, previously discussed (<a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>),
and so is shown with thick walls. This design is called
a &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; example of the center hall plan, for two reasons:
the hall is quite narrow, strictly a passage, and not overly
pleasant; and the stairway, although entered from the hall,
remains within space which belongs to an adjoining room.</p>

<p><a href="#fig43">Figure 43</a> shows a developed center hall, a wide and
pleasant place in which to linger. The stairway, now within
the hall, is not boxed in&mdash;as in the example above, but stands
in open space. It rises half a flight to a landing which runs
across the hall; the upper half of the stairway, of course, is
not shown in this first floor plan. Looking at the three
downstairs rooms, one recognizes the Quaker plan in grand,
developed form, with a fireplace in each room.</p>
<p><a href="#fig44">Figure 44</a> shows a four-room plan and also serves to
suggest the small variations and special features which may
be incorporated into any plan. The drawing represents the
original plan of the Old Brick House, already noted, (<a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>),
and is based upon information from the present
owners. Reading from left to right, there are back-to-back
corner fireplaces on the left wall, both served by one chimney,
thus economizing on masonry costs. The central hall is
wide, but no open stairway is mounted there; instead, the
boxed-in stair is located in space stolen from a side room,
as in plan <a href="#fig42">42</a>, above. The main room at right has a fascinating
chimney wall; a storage space on one side of the chimney
is balanced on the other side by a closet with window. The
famous carving which adorned this wall will be shown
later.</p>
<p>Thinking of the exterior appearance of this house, and
remembering that 18th-century men admired symmetry,
note how each entrance door is centered on its fa&ccedil;ade, even
though the hall is pushed slightly to one side. And note the
quiet symmetry of the two windows on the right, serenely
independent, yet obviously a determining factor in the
combination of installations along the interior of this wall.
Further, the flue to the off-center fireplace on this wall manages
to work toward the center of the wall as it rises, so
that it can emerge in a chimney properly centered to balance
the chimney on the other side of the house.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p><a href="#fig45">Figure 45</a> shows a side hall plan. It is like a center hall
house deprived of one of its wings. This design was popular
in fine late 18th-century city houses, where the hall was an
important show-place in the house. In our diagram the stair
rises in a straight run.</p>
<p>The sketches above presented simple one-, two-, and
three-room plans; then center hall plans with two, three,
and four rooms. All these divisions of space were found
within the basic rectangle enclosed by the outside walls of
the house. Further divisions were used, too. For example,
consider where the Palmer house (<a href="#fig14">figure 14</a>) fits into the
plans seen in this discussion.</p>
<h3>HOUSES WITH LEAN-TO AND BIG PORCH&mdash;THE SOUTHERN HOUSE</h3>
<p><a href="#fig46">Figure 46</a> shows a simple rectangular house on the left;
on the right the structure has sprouted a lean-to in the
rear and a porch across the front. These two sketches
illustrate a common development in the expansion of the
simple rectangular house. A lean-to simply &ldquo;leans against&rdquo;
the main frame of the house. The porch, often a precarious
structure on its delicate posts, depends for its support upon
the stable frame of the main block of the house also.</p>
<p>While some owners of simple rectangular houses enlarged
them by adding the lean-to and the big porch, other
colonists, seeing the attractiveness of this plan, built the
whole house, lean-to and porch, at one time.</p>
<p>In driving through North Carolina one sees hundreds of
houses similar to the one on the right. It has been called the
typical North Carolina farm house. It became popular in
towns as well as on farms. The big porch sweeping across
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the front provided very welcome living space during the
hot summer months, and the porch offered a sheltered place
for children to play in during inclement weather.</p>
<p>It may be surmised that the colonists also appreciated a
beauty in the design of this house. Where the earlier house
on the left is boxy and stiff, the house on the right has a
roof line that reaches out pleasantly from the center ridge
to the front and back. The front porch looks inviting and
friendly, like a room opening to the outside world. The other
house, with only a stoop at the front door, is really closed
to the world.</p>
<p>Consider the two houses as geometrical forms:&mdash;the first
house is merely a simple block. By contrast, the expanded
house has a more complicated geometrical nature for us to
think about and enjoy. It can be described as a central block
which has two, paired appendages, one of which is transparent.</p>
<p>Although the lean-to was found everywhere in the colonies,
the big porch is of Southern origin. It was employed first in
the North Carolina seacoast towns that conducted trade with
the West Indies, where similar colonnaded porches existed.</p>
<p>Turning now to the plans shown in <a href="#fig46">figure 46</a>, it may be
seen how the lean-to neatly adds two small rooms to the
rear of the structure. The main hall of the house continues
through the lean-to, and front and back doors give through-ventilation
to this long &ldquo;room.&rdquo; It was often the favorite
place for family living during hot summer months. The
stair in our plan begins in the back. However, there were
many variations in the location of the stair and, indeed, in
the use of this general design.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig47">figure 47</a> are shown some of the variations of the lean-to
and porch design in North Carolina houses of greatly differing
aspect. In <a href="#fig47">figure 47</a><i>a</i>, the basic house has a gambrel roof. This
is particularly charming, with three crisp roof planes on
either side of the central chimney. Beginning at front or back
the roof planes fold up to the center ridge and then fold
down again.</p>

<p><a href="#fig47">Figure 47</a><i>b</i> shows the whole house under one massive gable.
It looks particularly strong in contrast to the movement and
delicate grace of the roof in sketch <a href="#fig47">47</a><i>a</i>.</p>
<p>In sketch <a href="#fig47">47</a><i>c</i> the center block of the house pops up for two

<p>Sketch <a href="#fig47">47</a><i>d</i> shows a gambrel house with a lean-to but without

to show that either the lean-to or the big front
porch alone may occur on a house.</p>
<p>Sketch <a href="#fig47">47</a><i>e</i> shows two-tiered porches on both front and back.
If one big porch is considered desirable, two&mdash;or four&mdash;are
better. Two-tiered porches often are found on the great
mansions and plantation houses. Such porches were also a
feature of inns, providing ample sheltered space for guests
and their friends. It is just one step from the two-tiered
colonial porch shown here to the great porches of the early
republican period (for example, Mount Vernon, of the
1780&rsquo;s) where giant columns or piers rose through two
stories.</p>
<p>Having seen the sketches above, we now discuss a few
actual houses which incorporate the lean-to and big porch
design.</p>
<p><a href="#fig48">Figure 48</a>, the Hummock house, exhibits one of the
porches inspired by the West Indies which are characteristic
of its town, the old port of Beaufort. The group of visitors
in our photograph reflects the fame of this house which
attracts sightseers to the town.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The house is called by several names: <i>Hummock</i>, <i>Hommock</i>,
or <i>Hammock</i>. These unfamiliar words are variants
of, or are related to, the common word, <i>hillock</i>; and the
house does stand on relatively high ground in the eastern
part of present-day Beaufort. Years ago the house was called
the White House, as old inhabitants remember. Today it is
white for sure, its chimneys having been plastered over, it
stands there gleaming, its two great dormer eyes staring out
to the sea as if searching the horizon. And once, no doubt,
pilots of ships at sea looked toward the land, seeking this
white house to guide them through the narrow Beaufort
channel.</p>
<p><a href="#fig49">Figure 49</a>, a detail from James Wimble&rsquo;s mariners&rsquo; map
of &ldquo;The Province of North Carolina,&rdquo; published in London
in 1738, shows a ship lining itself up with the &ldquo;White house.&rdquo;
As recommended by Wimble whose purpose was to show
mariners how to avoid sand bars and shallow water in finding
their way to ports such as &ldquo;Beauford,&rdquo; the line of sight from
a ship at the point shown to the easily identifiable landmark
leads over the bar. If this White house shown on the map is,
indeed, the White House of present-day Beaufort, then it
was built before 1738, the date of the map.</p>
<p><a href="#fig50">Figure 50</a> depicts a fragment of the foundation of the
house. At left the great wooden sill rests upon a brick pier.
A heavy cross beam is inserted into the sill and is held in
place by two large wooden pegs with nicely carved heads.
Out on the cross beam a joist is inserted, a sliver of wood
being driven under the joist to bring it to proper height and
snugness. This sketch evokes the vision of colonists with
huge logs and simple hand tools engaged in the heroic project
of building a house.</p>
<p><a href="#fig51">Figure 51</a> is a diagram of the foundations of the house;
dotted lines encircle the fragment which was sketched above.
Heavy lines show the major floor beams; a few lighter,
parallel lines indicate joists. The heavy beams divide space
in a way to suggest the lean-to design:&mdash;there are two front
rooms, each with a fireplace at the middle of its wall, while
the rear section contains a small room on either side of a
hall in the center. In the diagram a stairway is included in
the hall also. This is said to be the original stairway, since
removed. Not shown in the diagram is the back porch,
which appears to be a later addition.</p>

<p>The Sloop Point house (<a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>) is another well known
house with a large porch. As much as any colonial house,
it is filled with novelties and mysteries. Also known as the
MacMillan house for the family which has owned it for
well over one hundred years, the structure stands facing the
Inland Waterway, at Sloop Point, just east of Wilmington.
Construction is thought to date from the late 1720&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Our photograph shows the impressive profile of the house,
all under one great gable roof, the porch end resting on
massive square piers. The chimney serves fireplaces in two
adjoining rooms and recalls the double chimney previously
seen in the Palmer house (<a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>). In the Palmer house
closets were constructed between the twin fireplaces, but
in the MacMillan house there are outside doors to first
floor and to basement. The present porch between the fireplaces
is a recent addition. The chimney is laid in Flemish
bond and, as can be seen, the upper part of the chimney,
blown off by a storm a few years ago, has been replaced
with brick laid in our 20th-century fashion.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig53">figure 53</a> the single chimney on the other side of the
house is shown. Below, the ballast stone base reveals a
fascinating collection of beach stones and coral in many
colors; above, the brick is laid in English bond which, as
mentioned earlier, contains alternating courses of headers
and stretchers. The different bonding systems used in the
two chimneys suggest that the chimneys were not built at
the same time, which is one of the mysteries of the house.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 54. PLAN OF THE SLOOP POINT HOUSE.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig54">Figure 54</a>, a plan of the Sloop Point house, illustrates
some of the novelties in the house. The designs of a central
block, plus a big porch in front and a shed addition in the
rear is readily apparent. The dotted line through the main
block represents a partition which was installed during the
19th century to create a central hall. Before this addition,
three rooms existed in simple Quaker plan. The hall is intended
solely for service, being only about 3&frac12; feet wide.
When the partition wall was added no attempt was made
to reproduce the original cornice and wainscot panelling of
the big room.</p>
<p>Between the twin fireplaces unusual twin doors may be
noted. They swing in and out from the corners of the fireplaces
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
in such a fashion that one room at a time is opened to
the porch. When both doors are swung out, there is passage
between the two rooms. The twin room toward the back of
the house has three doors along its rear wall; one leads to the
hall; the other two are believed to have led to closets in the
past.</p>
<p>Now we present two diagrams to aid in discussion of the
growth of the Sloop Point house from an early, smaller structure
(<a href="#fig55">figure 55</a>) to the house of today (<a href="#fig56">figure 56</a>). The roof
of the house was raised or &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; in the early 19th century,
according to one historian, but exactly what changes were
introduced at that time is not now known. The &ldquo;before and
after&rdquo; sketches are shown in order to demonstrate the extent
to which the house has evolved since its original construction.
Almost every old house shows evidence of changes; efforts to
determine the reasons for these modifications can tell the
student much about the fashions of times past and the
character of the people who dwelled in the structure.</p>
<p>The smaller, earlier house is built over a low basement
(suggested by dotted lines) the masonry walls of which serve
as the foundation of the building. The light porch has
delicate carved columns and a railing with banister posts. At
its outer side the porch rests on masonry piers; at the inner
side the porch&rsquo;s floor beams are inserted into the foundation
wall of the house. Stucco, applied over the ballast stone
foundations, has incised lines in imitation of stone blocks, as
suggested in the diagram. Today fragments of this incised
stucco may be seen here and there on the front and side
foundations.</p>

<p>The larger, present-day house with raised roof (<a href="#fig56">figure 56</a>)
has full-height second story rooms in the main block of the
house and additional space in front and back. Details
<i>P</i> and <i>R</i> indicate parts of the construction which use lumber
salvaged from some previous structure. <i>P</i> shows where four
carved porch posts are used as floor beams. <i>R</i> indicates three
banister rails used as studs in the back wall of an upper
room. Both the posts and the banister rails could have come
from an earlier porch on this house. The present porch uses
massive posts to support the heavy roof. To support the porch
on its house side, brick piers have been added in front of the
original ballast stone foundations. There are other details
of the house which suggest stages in its development; we
hope someone will study them someday.</p>
<p>To return to further examination of the curiosities suggested
in diagram <a href="#fig56">56</a>, dotted lines are shown to represent the
flow of air through an ingenious cooling system. Toward the
back of the house a hole in the floor allows air to rise from
underneath to ventilate a bedroom. At the front of the house,
an opening in the porch ceiling allows air to rise to a closet on
the second floor front, and thence to bedrooms.</p>
<p>One last unusual detail is the stairway in the back hall, the
banister posts of which are set diagonally, that is, perpendicular
to the hand rail rather than the steps.</p>
<p><a href="#fig57">Figure 57</a>, a drawing of a house from Brunswick Town,
near Wilmington, introduces an amazing new chapter in the
story of colonial architecture in North Carolina, a chapter
which is just being opened up in our day.</p>
<p>This house, the Hepburn-Reonalds house, built between
1734 and 1742, is of a type not seen before in this study. The
structure had a family porch without steps down to the street,
rather like a balcony, a protected place to sit and look at life
on the street. Below, in the basement was a shop, and in the
illustration a man is seen about to enter the street door of
the shop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the house does not exist today; the drawing
is &ldquo;conjectural,&rdquo; that is, it is an estimate based upon study
and analysis of ruins (<a href="#fig58">figure 58</a>) at Brunswick Town. Knowledge
of this kind of house in North Carolina, and of the
town is a dramatic development of the last few years.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 59. DETAIL FROM SAUTHIER&rsquo;s DRAWING OF BRUNSWICK TOWN IN 1769.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Brunswick Town, founded in 1726, was a thriving port
town in colonial times, as might be imagined from the map
(<a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>), a detail from Sauthier&rsquo;s drawing of Brunswick
Town in 1769. At the time of the Revolution the town was
burned and fell to ruins. During the War between the States,
many bricks and stones were taken from Brunswick Town&rsquo;s
ruins for use in the construction of Fort Anderson, adjacent
to the town site. Our photograph of the ruins of the Hepburn-Reonalds
house shows this-one may see that many of
the stones and bricks from the chimneys have been removed.
During the century after the war the remaining foundations
of the town&rsquo;s buildings all but disappeared into the ground,
being covered by washes of soil and dense jungle of brush
and trees. Only the great brick walls of St. Philip&rsquo;s Church
(marked &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the map) remained as a reminder of the
once thriving town. In 1958, however, the State Department
of Archives and History began a project to clear the land, dig
out the foundations of houses, and search for objects left by
the colonists, all in order to recover an image of the town and
the way of life of its citizens.</p>
<p>Thus far some sixty ruins have been discovered by the
archaeologist in charge of the work. In digging around a
ruin he works very carefully; all the soil removed is sifted,
thereby bringing to light coins, buckles, broken pottery, door
hinges, and other items. Some of the richest finds have been
uncovered in garbage and refuse pits.</p>
<p>While the work of the archaeologist continues, Brunswick
Town has been opened to the public as an open air museum&mdash;quite
an unusual exhibit, one found in few places in the
world. As one walks down the streets there are display cases
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
at individual ruins. The cases contain objects found at the
site, as well as drawings of houses as they probably looked
before burning.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of Brunswick Town&rsquo;s houses
is the Hepburn-Reonalds house. According to Stanley South,
archaeologist in charge,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the second floor porch was an architectural feature borrowed from
the West Indies, where this style of architecture was popular. Many
of the homes in Brunswick were of this type, with a cellar partly
sunk below the surface of the ground and a garret above the main
floor of the house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the photograph and drawing are examined carefully,
the steps which lead down and the path to the basement door
may be seen. The photograph also reveals the remaining
foundations for the posts which supported the porch. The
basement is divided into two rooms; the nearer room was a
kitchen which was entered from the rear of the house.</p>
<p>On the Sauthier map (<a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>) the Hepburn-Reonalds
house is marked by an arrow. Looking carefully at the map
one sees indications of certain details shown in the drawing,
such as the fence running along the street, the barn and
garden, and the fence leading to the barn. The drawing was
made by Don Mayhew, staff artist of the Brunswick Town
project.</p>
<p>One question the reader may have in mind: how does one
know the name and date of this house? Very complete records
of the sale of property in Brunswick Town have been preserved
in nearby Wilmington and Southport. By careful study
of these records and of the Sauthier map it has been possible
for the archaeologist to identify and date the various ruins in
the town.</p>

<p class="pcap">FIGURE 60. WAKEFIELD, RALEIGH.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Wakefield (<a href="#fig60">figure 60</a>) is the oldest house in Raleigh. It was
built in 1760 by Joel Lane, who later sold the original tract
of 1,000 acres of land for the new state capital. The sale, it
is said, took place in this house on Joel Lane&rsquo;s farm. The
house was moved a few years ago to its present site&mdash;not far
from its original location&mdash;and now is owned and maintained
by the Wake County Colonial Dames.</p>
<p>As the photograph shows, it is a gambrel house with shed
addition in the rear, but, unlike houses we have just been
discussing, it has only a small porch in front. It is probable
that the house originally looked quite differently, for construction
details in the vicinity of the roof suggest that it
once had a gable roof. Further, the smooth sheathing over
the front of the house (often found under the porches of
colonial homes) suggests that originally a shed porch ran
across the entire front of the house. With long porch and
gable roof, Wakefield would have looked like the typical
farm shown in the sketch, <a href="#fig46">figure 46</a>.</p>
<p>In the Joel Lane house as it stands today, the porch, the
chimneys, and the modern shingles differ slightly in design
from those elements seen in old photographs and drawings of
the dwelling. In the back of the house, barely noticeable in
the photograph, is an addition beyond the lean-to. This later
appendage was once attached to the left side of the house; in
its present relocation it is occupied by the caretaker of this
exhibition house.</p>
<p><a href="#fig61">Figure 61</a> shows plans, elevations and details of Wakefield.
Such careful drawings are the sort which present-day architects
prepare for the use of carpenters building a house.
While the colonial architect or builder did not make such
elaborate drawings, the plans of important old buildings, are
today being made as an historical record. The drawings
shown are from a collection being developed at State College,
Raleigh, further explained at the end of this booklet.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The first floor plan at lower right shows the porch, the
main block of the house, and a room of the lean-to in rear. In
the main block are a larger and a smaller side room, with a
hall between. The entrances at front and back of the hall are
wide double doors, facilitating good ventilation during hot
summer days in Raleigh. The door to the larger room is
centered &ldquo;as it should be&rdquo;; but the corresponding door to the
opposite room has necessarily been pushed forward by the
stairway. It will be noted that whereas the outer framed walls
of the house are fairly thick, the walls which partition the
hall are extremely thin&mdash;a point which will be discussed
presently.</p>
<p>At upper left in the page of drawings is a transverse section
through the hall. We see how the stairway folds neatly within
the main block of the house as it rises. The stair has a railing,
but no procession of banister posts, thus bespeaking an
economy and rugged plainness&mdash;but a visitor must watch his
step. At the top, the stair ends in an upper hall lighted by a
dormer window. At the back is a corresponding dormer. As
our drawing is a section through these windows, it does not
give an immediately clear notion of the gambrel roof. However,
just beneath each window can be seen part of the lower
plane of the roof.</p>
<p><a href="#fig62">Figure 62</a> shows the large front room of Wakefield, as
restored and furnished by the Colonial Dames. The room
with one wall of plaster and the other of wood, looks almost
&ldquo;modern.&rdquo; The wood wall showed in the plan as very thin,
as we have noted. The similar wood partition on the other
side of the hall shows through the open door. To have
covered these partition walls with plaster would have been
quite an additional expense to the builder; and so one finds
that the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; effect is in reality a by-product of simple
economy. Looking carefully at the open door on the left, one
notes the small wooden pegs which lock the horizontal and
vertical frame members together.</p>

<p>The interior from Wakefield, just seen (<a href="#fig62">figure 62</a>), represents
one idea about how the walls of a room should be
treated. There were other schemes for the treatment of the
main room of a house; some of these are illustrated in <a href="#fig63">figure 63</a>
and in the following sketches.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig63">figure 63</a> parts of the great frame of a wooden house
project unashamedly through the smooth plaster walls and
ceiling. Running across the middle of the ceiling is the large
center beam of the house. A similar member along the outside
edge of the ceiling might be expected to continue all
the way around the room as a cornice, but it does not. At
the floor line, however, a base board does continue around
the room, but it is heavier under the window wall. The
chair rail (the board or rail installed about the height of the
back of chair, to protect the plaster from damage) does continue
around the room, but at the corner it develops special
bracing not employed where the rail joins the frame of the
door.</p>
<p>Such irregular features suggest a skeleton of the house
going beyond the present room. The builder of this dwelling
was unconcerned if one wall was different from another&mdash;perhaps
he felt a keen satisfaction in the wooden structure of
his house and was pleased to have this framework reflected in
the interior. This spirit is occasionally seen in the less important
rooms of a colonial house (for example in the
Palmer house), but it is rarely found in the main rooms of
extant colonial homes.</p>

<p><a href="#fig64">Figure 64</a>, also a simple interior, is more expressive of what
colonial builders desired. The cornice, the chair rail, and
the base board continue around corners without any change
in character. Thus the room appears as a box having its
own order, independent of irregularities in the frame of the
house. Chair rail and base board are almost always found,
because they were necessary to protect the plaster. The
cornice, although occasionally missing, is usually present&mdash;as
though the builders felt it was necessary to mark the upper
edge of the cube of the room. The fireplace is adorned with
surrounding panels. A fireplace is psychologically an important
place in the room&mdash;it is the source of warmth and the
place where people gather&mdash;and, therefore, it is honored with
special decoration.</p>
<p>A more elaborate interior is shown in <a href="#fig65">figure 65</a>. The
mantelpiece rises to the ceiling and has some carved details.
A paneled wood wainscot runs around the lower part of the
wall. The inset sketch shows a long plank sometimes used in
the wainscot, and left exposed as a long panel. The front is
glassy smooth, the back is rough hewn and notched to fit
snugly against the upright posts. Such a long panel of wood
is not overly impressive when used today&mdash;it is just a sheet of
plywood&mdash;but in a colonial house it is something to awe a
modern carpenter.</p>
<p><a href="#fig66">Figure 66</a> shows an exceptionally elaborate room inspired,
perhaps, by pattern books or memories of England. The
mantelpiece is an elaborate concoction of many units piled
one on top of the other&mdash;ledges, columns, a gable pediment&mdash;a
display of the carver&rsquo;s skill. The walls are fully covered by
a series of vertical panels above and horizontal panels below.</p>

<p>Having seen in the above sketches some of the notions
which colonial builders had for finishing the important
rooms in a house, we will look at photographs of two fully
paneled rooms, one plain and the other elaborately carved.</p>
<p><a href="#fig67">Figure 67</a> is an interior from the Lane house, Nixonton,
shown as an example of a simple, fully paneled room. This
Nixonton house is the second Lane house to be discussed in
this study; the first was Wakefield, the Joel Lane dwelling in
Raleigh. Our photograph shows one of three rooms from
the Nixonton Lane house, as now installed in the Carolina
Room at the University of North Carolina. This is the
section of the University library which contains books,
pamphlets, old photographs and newspapers, all referring
to North Carolina. It seems appropriate that the Lane interiors
should be at this center for studies of North Carolina
history and culture. The installation was accomplished
under the direction of Thomas Waterman, student and
author of works on North Carolina architecture.</p>
<p>The over-all design of the room shown consists of panels
set in a lattice of vertical and horizontal strips. Window height
determines the three-part division of the wall&mdash;tall vertical
panels in the middle, and short horizontal panels above and
below. This scheme is repeated in smaller scale at the mantel.
The emotionally important fireplace is given a few further
touches of embellishment&mdash;a carved mantel shelf and
pilasters at the edges above. (A <i>pilaster</i> is a rectangular
support treated as a column with a base, shaft, and capital.)</p>

<p><a href="#fig68">Figure 68</a> is inserted into our account at this point to aid
in discussion of a special beauty in this room, the expression
of a craftsman-builder. The drawing shows a section of the
wall in the photograph. In his actual construction of the
paneling, it appears that the craftsman followed these steps:
<i>1st</i>) erected uprights marked 1 and 1, which rise all the way
from floor to ceiling, corresponding to the posts which frame
door and window; <i>2nd</i>) cut and fit the strips marked 2 and 2,
which fit neatly between the uprights; <i>3rd</i>) erected the secondary
upright marked 3; <i>4th</i>) fitted in the short pieces marked
4, the location of these strips being determined by the framing
of the window. The above sequence of steps is the natural,
rule-of-thumb way to proceed; the craftsman does not need
a blue print&mdash;or even a ruler. Thus the wall expresses the
craftsman-builder at work, suggests his simple procedures
and his delight with his material, wood, whose satiny surface
is brought out in the room.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p><a href="#fig69">Figure 69</a> shows a sketch and a plan of the Lane house at
Nixonton. It is a simple one-story building which looks down
peacefully on the Little River. Sometimes it is called the Old
Customs House, or the Old River House. It is dated in the
1740&rsquo;s, some years before the other Lane house, Wakefield,
in Raleigh.</p>
<p>The plan of the house is a clean-cut example of the three
room idea advocated by William Penn. The big room was
seen in our photograph (<a href="#fig67">figure 67</a>). The two smaller rooms
had walls of plaster. Foundations above ground are of brick;
below ground are the stone walls of a low cellar. It may be
remarked that there is no stair to the loft. The loft window
shown in the sketch was &ldquo;just for looks,&rdquo; according to old
settlers. Today, however, the loft is reached via an addition
to the house, not shown in the sketch.</p>
<p><a href="#fig70">Figure 70</a>, an interior from the earlier mentioned Old
Brick House, is shown as an example of an elaborately
paneled room. It was put into the Old Brick House about
mid 18th century, at about the time of the simple Lane interior,
just seen above. It is opulent, high-spirited, robust.
Perhaps its swashbuckling grandeur would appeal to a
pirate and could, therefore, be used to support the legend
that Blackbeard once lived in this house. The legend, however,
is unfounded; Blackbeard had been dead for many
years before this room was executed, and similar interiors
are found in other North Carolina houses known to have
been built by highly respectable owners.</p>
<p>The Old Brick interior stands in sharp contrast to the
chaste Lane interior. Whereas the Lane interior expresses
simple wood structure, as we have seen, the Old Brick interior
suggests stone. The row of energetic pilasters support a
very convincing &ldquo;stone&rdquo; architrave above, and the arches are
constructed complete with keystones as found in stone work.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The Old Brick House&rsquo;s interior has left North Carolina.
The photograph shown portrays the fireplace wall as it is
installed in a house in Delaware, its proportions changed
to make it fit a higher room. An older photograph, <a href="#fig71">figure 71</a>,
shows the door along the wall in the original room. By comparing
the before-and-after photographs it can be seen how
blocks were inserted under the pilasters to accommodate them
to the height of the room and providing more head room
above the arch. In the original room the pilasters stood emphatically
&ldquo;on the ground.&rdquo; The door proudly &ldquo;raised itself
to its full height,&rdquo; the keystone of its arch touching the
enframement above. The more the two photographs are
compared, the greater the appreciation one has for the particular
nature of the original room, and the intention of its
designer. It had a dynamic pride, in contrast with a politeness
which characterizes the later room.</p>
<p>The re-installed room has also changed the original arrangement
of parts along the wall&mdash;the door, the mantelpiece,
and the cabinet. The original arrangement of these units may
be seen by looking carefully at <a href="#fig71">figure 71</a>, and also the plan
of the Old Brick House, <a href="#fig44">figure 44</a>.</p>

<br />A Note on Later Colonial Architecture</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p048.jpg" alt="Log cabin" width="600" height="340" />
</div>
<p>The scope of this booklet does not include architecture of
the late colonial and early republican times, although some
of our most distinguished &ldquo;colonial&rdquo; buildings date from
those years. The architectural climate of the late 18th century
differed from that found prior to 1763. First of all, following
the end of the French and Indian War the colonies were
more secure. Then, there existed a large body of earlier
architecture which could be seen as accomplished fact. The
building trades were more firmly established, a few professional
architects were beginning to appear, and architectural
pattern books and design books were more available
from Europe. Although the earlier buildings were vigorous
in their design, the wealthy person who wished to build a
home in later colonial times often looked on them as quaint
and a little clumsy; he wanted something better and more
up-to-date.</p>
<p>An outstanding example of what was up-to-date in North
Carolina, is shown above, an engraving of Tryon Palace,
New Bern. This structure was begun by Governor Tryon in
1767, completed in 1770 and destroyed by fire shortly after
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
the Revolutionary War. The work of reconstruction, begun
in 1952 is now virtually complete, and the palace is now
one of the most widely known colonial buildings in the
United States. It is a good example for our present purposes
because, as a most important and costly building, it reflects
ideas regarded as &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in North Carolina at the close
of the pre-revolutionary period. The engraving shown is from
<i>The Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution</i>, by Benjamin J.
Lossing, 1852. Although the palace was in ruins during Lossing&rsquo;s
time, he made his engraving from drawings left by
the building&rsquo;s architect&mdash;the same drawings used in 1952 for
its reconstruction. The palace was designed to impress the
colonial man and woman shown in the illustration in certain
ways, as will be seen presently.</p>
<p>The exterior of the palace exhibits something new in our
study: a three-part layout design, diagrammed in <a href="#fig72">figure 72</a>.
Above in the diagram the three structures are arranged:
kitchen&mdash;PALACE&mdash;stables. Other outbuildings which, of
course, were present are hidden in the first and main view
of the palace. This is quite different from the disposition of
the outbuildings at the Palmer-Marsh house (<a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>),
where they are found informally situated at one side of the
house.</p>
<p>At the middle of the diagram depicting the Tryon structure,
the long fa&ccedil;ade of the palace building is shown broken into
three parts: wing&mdash;CENTRAL BLOCK&mdash;wing. The central
block is crowned with a pediment and is advanced slightly
forward. The Palmer house also has six windows and a central
door, but the builder of this earlier structure did not
have the idea of breaking or articulating a long wall as in
the palace.</p>
<p>Below in the diagram, the central block of the palace
shows window&mdash;DOOR&mdash;window. That door, crowned with
pediment, is the ultimate focal point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<div class="img" id="ill80">
<img id="fig72" src="images/p049.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="722" />
<p class="pcap">FIGURE 72.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>As one contemplates this three-part idea for dividing a
length of wall, or for grouping separate structures, the system
seems to express an &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; in the architecture&mdash;the
door or middle unit being a head or center of serene intelligence
and the symmetrical side units being arms or body.
This design idea was not introduced into the colonies via the
palace; the palace merely demonstrates the idea which became
so attractive to later 18th-century builders.</p>
<p>The two pediments referred to above&mdash;a big one above
and a small one over the door below&mdash;are not mere gables of
the sort seen earlier. Instead, they are complete, three-sided
pediments similar to those found on classical temples. They
are a sign of a rising interest in classical art, fostered by
archaeological studies in the 18th century. Classical buildings
also contained ideas of sober mass and order which impressed
those who lived in the late 18th century.</p>
<p>It should be observed that the cornices of all three buildings
continue uninterruptedly around corners, marking a
firm top for the lower part of the buildings which appear as
great boxes. Further, as all the buildings have hipped roofs
which retreat on all sides, the colonial man and woman in
the picture, as they come near a building, do not see a roof
at all. This image is in contrast with the earlier architecture
with huge, steep roofs sitting like massive hats on the buildings,
and with gable ends rising to sharp points in the sky,
along with their protruding chimneys. At the palace, chimneys
do not disturb the calm surface of a rectangular wall,
and roofs are hidden as though one is ashamed of them.</p>
<p>The windows of the palace are in absolutely regular
horizontal and vertical rows, as opposed to the casual, hit-or-miss
irregularities seen in some earlier buildings. In preparing
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
his drawings for the fa&ccedil;ade of the palace, the architect
must have erased and redrawn his windows before he
achieved just the rhythm and balance he wanted. In looking
at his drawing he saw the fa&ccedil;ade as an entity by itself, exactly
as it was seen by the colonial couple on the walk. They seem
to feel the articulate order of the building, a security and a
restrained, aristocratic elegance.</p>
<p>Such ideas afford one a glimpse into the proud, ambitious,
&ldquo;enlightened,&rdquo; later 18th century. After this glimpse we
return to the diverse buildings of the earlier 18th century,
with fuller appreciation of their robustness and good-natured
vitality, each building seeming something of heroic accomplishment,
a feat of colonial man, which, indeed, it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="smaller">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />The Study of Old Architecture</h2>
<p>Aside from pleasure to be derived from it, the study of
old buildings can be of great value to future students of
North Carolina architecture. An important old building in
one&rsquo;s town today may be a filling station tomorrow. Every
day such buildings vanish through fire or demolition and
often there are no adequate records of them. Such records
can only be made by people on the spot who appreciate their
importance.</p>
<p>Steps that can be taken by the student include: making a
study of an old building in the vicinity; taking photographs
of various exterior views and interior details; making plan
drawings with measurements; making simple sketches and
diagrams of construction details which cannot be photographed
well; and making a plot plan or map of the property,
showing the location of former sheds and other structures.
In addition, efforts should be made to collect information
from old inhabitants and from present users of the
building. Deeds, old letters, or other documents should be
consulted for information regarding the structure&rsquo;s origins.
A map of the old part of your town&mdash;<i>&agrave; la Sauthier</i>&mdash;might be
a useful contribution to supplement information on the
founding of the town and on changes as they have occurred.</p>
<p>Such studies would be valuable additions to a collection
of documents, photographs, maps, etc., housed in the local
library. Work with teachers, librarians, and members of the
local historical society to build a collection of books and
material on local and regional architecture.</p>
<p>There are several State institutions in Raleigh which
may provide assistance with projects of this kind. The Department
of Archives and History, houses a vast collection
of documents and letters, and publishes the <i>North Carolina</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
<i>Historical Review</i>. Within this department the Hall of
History sponsors the <i>Junior Historians</i>, who make models of
buildings and engage in other architectural projects; and
the Historic Sites Division is concerned with the preservation
of important sites and buildings. The Department of Conservation
and Development has a photograph collection of
old buildings in North Carolina. The School of Design at
State College has a growing collection of measured drawings
of important old buildings; this project is called Historic
Buildings Research (see <a href="#fig61">figure 61</a>).</p>
<p>In Chapel Hill, at the University of North Carolina there
are two sections of the library to be noted: the Carolina
Room, which houses extensive collections of historical materials
(see <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>); and the Southern Historical Collection,
which contains letters and documents. Duke University has
large collections of documentary material; and other college
and city libraries have North Carolina collections.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
